# FAQ

Using custom elements may cause many problems that you haven't considered before. Here are some common problems and solutions.

#### Q: Compatibility

Gem only guarantees to support the newer version of Chrome/Firefox/Safari.

#### Q: SVG symbols

- Use `<gem-use>`, see [example](https://github.com/mantou132/gem/tree/master/packages/gem-examples/src/svg-icon)
- Use [font-icon](https://css-tricks.com/html-for-icon-font-usage/)

#### Q: URL Hash cannot be located, `:target` has no effect

The element internally listen `HashChangeEvent`, see [example](https://github.com/mantou132/gem/tree/master/packages/gem-examples/src/hash)

#### Q: `document.activeElement` no effect

`document.activeElement` may no longer meet your expectations, but due to the existence of [`DocumentOrShadowRoot.activeElement`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentOrShadowRoot/activeElement), you still have a chance to get the results you want.

#### Q: SSR

SSR is currently not available. Although the [Declarative Shadow DOM](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Declarative-Shadow-DOM.md) can provide pre-rendering, but because he cannot serialize [Constructable Stylesheets](https://web.dev/constructable-stylesheets/), so you can only provide some help for SEO.

#### Q: Use React/Vue components?

- `<slot>` mount
- Only use Light DOM + [CSS in JS](./001-basic/006-styled-element.md#css-in-js)
- Mount manually and use `<link>` to load the corresponding style
- Use [`<gem-frame>`](https://github.com/mantou132/gem-frame), this is a heavy solution, not recommended

#### Q: Repeated element definition

- Use Webpack's [`externals`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/externals/) to uniformly introduce dependencies
- Naming convention constraints in the team

#### Q: Property and method override

The following methods will cause `GemElement` to not work properly when overridden:

- `GemElement.connectedCallback`
- `GemElement.attributeChangedCallback`
- `GemElement.disconnectedCallback`
- `GemElement.internals`

Internal properties and methods are recommended to use [Private Field](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields)

#### Q: Similar [`React.Fragment`](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)?

No. You can use `:host {display: contents }` to reduce style writing, but too much ShadowRoot will still waste hardware resources.

#### Q: Immutable Store

Use [immutablejs](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js) or [immuerjs](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) in `updateStore` to keep the `Store` before the update.
